    <h2>About the Aurora</h2>
    <p>The aurora borealis, commonly known as the northern lights, is a captivating natural light display primarily seen in high-latitude regions around the Arctic. This phenomenon occurs when charged particles from the sun collide with gases in Earth's atmosphere, producing vibrant light displays. Auroras can also appear in the southern hemisphere, where they are called the aurora australis.</p>

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Auroras are created when solar wind, a stream of charged particles from the sun, interacts with Earth's magnetic field.</li>
        <li>The colors of the aurora can vary widely, including green, pink, red, yellow, blue, and violet, depending on the type of gas and the altitude at which the collisions occur.</li>
        <li>The optimal time to witness the aurora borealis is during the winter months, especially between September and April, when nights are longer and darker.</li>
        <li>In various cultures, the aurora is viewed as a mystical phenomenon, often associated with folklore, such as being seen as spirits of ancestors in Indigenous Arctic cultures.</li>
